GoGreen - An android app to support "Swachh Bharat Mission"  by increasing people's involvement through the app.

In this app there are two major sections :
1) One for uploading the current scenario of a pace needed to be cleaned 
2) Viewing the lists of places needed to be cleaned in the locality of the current user. Through this interface the user can select a place, he/she wants to volunteer in cleaning. Places are reviewed by different users based on its current condition.

We can further improve this app by using different apis. For example we can use "google maps" api to provide cloud notification, as soon as a photo is uploaded, to the users near that current location.
